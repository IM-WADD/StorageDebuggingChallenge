# Storage Debugging Challenge

Run index.html to try the game.

The game has four bugs related to storage. Your task is to find them.

The code related to storage is in:
- home.js
- play.js (scroll down to the saveScores() function at the bottom and ignore the rest.)
- log.js

You may work in teams.

The solutions will be posted in Lecture-Examples after class.
